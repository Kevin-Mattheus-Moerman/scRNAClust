Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 27 of /project/6052548/Lab/MRNA_pipe/Pipe/Snakemake/Visualize/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/home/emiliano/projects/def-cdesouza/Lab/MRNA_pipe/Pipe/output/visualize/cMatrix/LaManno.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
