Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 14 of /project/6052548/Lab/MRNA_pipe/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
{config[DIRECTORIES][PREPROCESS_DIRECTORY]}/ceftype_LaManno.cef
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
